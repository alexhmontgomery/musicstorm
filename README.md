# MusicStorm

MusicStorm is a site that allows user to search for artists and stream their music by calling the Soundcloud.com API. This project is built with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML & CSS.

I created this project during my time at The Iron Yard coding bootcamp.

## Development Notes
This was my first major project that handled making calls to an API. I learned a lot about accessing APIs and how to handle the results that are returned.  

Prior to development of this project, SoundCloud implemented a feature that allows certain (most) artists to have a premium account that would require you to pay a monthly fee to stream their content. Because of this, the site that I developed only allows you to stream a very limited number of artists. This severely limits the usability of the site. Essentially, the site only works for indie bands and artists that are less popular. Here are a couple of the artist that do work though:
* Post Malone
* Lanco
* Paul Wall
* Chance the Rapper
* Thrice
* Forrest
